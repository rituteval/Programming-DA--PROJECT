    "Synthetic data is information that's artificially manufactured rather than generated by real-world events. Synthetic data is created algorithmically, and it is used as a stand-in for test datasets of production or operational data, to validate mathematical models and, increasingly, to train machine learning models.\n",
    "Simulation, allows us to build a mathematical model of the world and run it several times on a computer. This allows us to evaluate various decisions and choose between them. That is, make decisions. This was an attempt to describe Simulation in simpler words. Letâ€™s deep dive into the mathematics and code. R is certainly my go-to language when it comes to statistics and probabilities, thereof I have written all the codes in R to simulate different processes here."
