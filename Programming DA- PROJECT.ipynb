    "Sometimes simulation can be useful tool, and sometimes can be not useful tool. So what it is useful when, we have a complex system and we have a simulation it helps us understand internal interactions, that go behind or the relationships, that are there between the entities and you can understand better how these entities interact with each other rather than just having the complex system being deployed and then understanding it. \n",

    "The knowledge gained in designing a simulatiom model can be of\n",

    "Synthetic data is information that's artificially manufactured rather than generated by real-world events. Synthetic data is created algorithmically, and it is used as a stand-in for test datasets of production or operational data, to validate mathematical models and, increasingly, to train machine learning models.\n",
    "Simulation, allows us to build a mathematical model of the world and run it several times on a computer. This allows us to evaluate various decisions and choose between them. That is, make decisions. This was an attempt to describe Simulation in simpler words. Letâ€™s deep dive into the mathematics and code. Python is very good language for statistics and probabilities,."
